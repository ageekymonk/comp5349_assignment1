\chapter{Introduction}
	This report describes the following, for each of the Hadoop Mapreduce problem given.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Design
	\item Details of Each Job
	\item Performance Characteristics
	\item Alternate Designs
	\end{enumerate}

	Our goal in the assignment was to implement a scalable, modular and efficient solution for the problem given. One of our major challenges was proliferation of map reduce jobs. With naive implementation we had several chained map reduce job but with careful use of composite keys, custom sorting, partition and grouping we could efficiently optimize out few jobs.
